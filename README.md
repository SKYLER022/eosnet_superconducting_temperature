EosNet is a powerful tool to predict property of structures. In this project I will focus on how to generate type-I metal-B-C clathrate and get their predicted Tc through EosNet.
1.Prepare a csv file with strutures and their superconducting temperature. Place csv file in the same folder of related structure file and train MLP through EOSNET.
2.Generate type-I metal-B-C clathrate and get their predicted Tc.
3.
