EosNet is a powerful tool to predict property of structures. In this project I will focus on how to generate type-I metal-B-C clathrate and get their predicted Tc through EosNet.  
1.Prepare a csv file with strutures and their superconducting temperature. Place csv file in the same folder of related structure file and train MLP through EOSNET. Example is in superconductor folder.  
2.Generate type-I metal-B-C clathrate and get their predicted Tc. The clathrate dataset has about 4000 structures.
